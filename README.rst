 Cheat for https://semantle.novalis.org/
=========================================

The cheat is very simple: We submit the three words *man, red, two* to the game
and then `triangulateÂ´ the solution.

This works because all words are positioned in a linear vector space.  The way
this works is very similar to the way a GPS receiver calculates your position
from your distance to three satellites.

.. note::

   Everybody that knows how to use a web debugger will find an even simpler
   cheat because at the start of the game the browser will download a list of
   *all* past and future solution words.
